This directory hierarchy contains node binaries compiled for the various
platforms supported by pants.

Run ./build-node-4.2.4.sh
It will download the the binary tarball for the linux-x86, linux-x64, and darwin-x64 platforms,
extract each and re-create the archive with the contents under a folder just called "node",
then place copies or symlinks under each Mac/Linux platform. (The Mac directory has just one copy,
under 10.11, and the other OS X versions have symlinks to that copy.)
